# Ishare
Voice-Controlled Object Detection with YOLOv9
Overview
Ishare is a Python-based application that integrates voice commands with the YOLOv9 object detection model. This combination allows users to interactively detect and identify objects in images or video streams using simple voice instructions.

Features
Voice-Controlled Interaction: Utilize voice commands to initiate and control object detection processes.
Real-Time Object Detection: Leverage the YOLOv9 model for fast and accurate object detection in various environments.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, enabling users with minimal technical expertise to operate the application effectively.
How It Works
Voice Command Input: The application listens for specific voice commands from the user.
Command Processing: Captured voice commands are processed and translated into actionable instructions.
Object Detection Execution: Based on the processed command, the application utilizes the YOLOv9 model to perform object detection on the provided image or video stream.
Results Presentation: Detected objects are highlighted and presented to the user, either through visual markers or auditory feedback.
